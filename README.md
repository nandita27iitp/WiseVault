## Inspiration for the Project:

Automated financial planning tools utilize AI to assist users in efficientlymanaging their finances. By analyzing spending habits, offering budgetingadvice, and giving personalized tips, these tools help optimize financial well-being. Financial planning plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve their financial goals, manage risks, build wealth, and secure a stable financial future.  Recognizing that many individuals struggle to manage their finances due to time constraints, our app provides users with accessibility, personalized services, risk management, and educational resources to support them in reaching these objectives. WiseVault provides a comprehensive approach to money management through its user-friendly features such as portfolio management, expense tracking, and future planning. The app includes an AI-driven chatbot, detailed analytics, payment reminders, money-saving suggestions, and personalized recommendations, making financial management simple and fulfilling.
